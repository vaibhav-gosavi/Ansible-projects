Project: Automating Nginx Installation and Configuration

Objective:
The objective of this project is to automate the installation and configuration of Nginx on a slave EC2 instance using Ansible. By doing so, we can ensure consistent and reproducible setups of Nginx across multiple hosts.

Steps to Achieve the Objective:

Inventory Setup:

Create an inventory file or use an existing one to define the target hosts (slave EC2 instances) where Nginx will be installed and configured.
Playbook Creation:

Create a playbook file, such as nginx-installation.yml, to define the tasks that Ansible will perform.
Use a text editor to open the playbook file and add the following contents:
yaml

- name: Install and start Nginx
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
Customize the Playbook:

Customize the playbook according to your needs. For example, you can specify specific hosts or groups in the hosts section instead of using all. You can also add additional tasks to configure Nginx further, such as modifying the Nginx configuration file or adding SSL certificates.
Run the Playbook:

Ensure that Ansible is installed on your control node.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your playbook file is located.
Execute the playbook by running the following command:
css

ansible-playbook nginx-installation.yml -i inventory.ini

Ansible will connect to the target hosts defined in the inventory, install Nginx using the package manager (apt), and start the Nginx service using the service manager.
Verify the Installation:

Connect to the slave EC2 instance(s) and verify that Nginx is installed and running by executing commands like sudo systemctl status nginx or accessing the Nginx default page in a web browser.
By completing these steps, you will have successfully automated the installation and configuration of Nginx using Ansible. This project showcases your ability to use Ansible for infrastructure provisioning and configuration management, which can be a valuable skill for DevOps roles.

Remember to adjust the playbook, inventory, and any additional configurations to suit your specific environment and requirements. You can also enhance the project by adding error handling, parameterization, or more advanced Nginx configurations based on your needs.Project: Automating Nginx Installation and Configuration

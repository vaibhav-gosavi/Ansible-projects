:Launch an EC2 Instance:

Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the EC2 service.
Launch a new EC2 instance, ensuring that it meets your requirements in terms of instance type, security groups, and other configurations.
Choose an appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for your instance, such as Ubuntu, CentOS, or Amazon Linux, which includes the necessary software repositories for package installation.
Connect to the EC2 Instance:

Once the instance is launched and running, use SSH to connect to the EC2 instance using a terminal or SSH client.
Obtain the SSH key pair associated with the instance during launch, which will allow you to authenticate and connect securely.
Prepare the EC2 Instance:

Update the package repositories and upgrade the system packages by running the following commands:
bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
Install Ansible:

Install Ansible on the EC2 instance by running the following command:
bash

sudo apt install ansible -y
Create the Ansible Playbook:

Create a file called install-apache-php-mysql.yml on the EC2 instance using a text editor.
Copy and paste the corrected YAML code install-apache-php-mysql.yml file.
Run the Ansible Playbook:

Execute the Ansible playbook by running the following command:
bash

ansible-playbook install-apache-php-mysql.yml
Ansible will connect to the target host(s) (in this case, your local EC2 instance), install Apache, PHP, and MySQL packages, and configure them accordingly.
Verify the Installation:

Once the playbook execution is complete, you can verify the installation by checking if Apache, PHP, and MySQL are running correctly.
Test Apache by accessing the EC2 instance's public IP or DNS name in a web browser. You should see the default Apache page.
To check PHP, create a PHP file in the Apache web root directory (/var/www/html/) with the following content:
php

<?php phpinfo(); ?>
Access the PHP file in a web browser, and you should see the PHP information page.
Finally, verify the installation of MySQL by connecting to the MySQL server and performing basic database operations.
